a) A quality score of Q30 would indicate that all reads a corresponding call accuracy of 99.99% (This is why Q30 is considered a benchmark for quality in next-generation sequencing). 
When looking at the data, all of our mean Q scores are above 30 meaning the data is highly accurate. I would use a quality score of 20 to ensure that these high quality reads are not 
negated (keeping in mind that my graph only portrays the mean quality score). Furthermore using Q20 still has a high corresponding call accuraacy of 99%.

-Note that I used a quality score cutoff of 2. This occured when I filtered out all indexes with an N into a seperate file. The reason I chose to use a QS cutoff of 2 was because from my preliminary data exploration, the data was of good quality and I felt this was sufficient to get rid of any outliers. 

-TACCGGAT-TACCGGAT	76363857	21.02%
21.2% of matched reads were from this index which I found interesting. This is noteably higher than the reads from any other indexes. Potentially it is overrepresentative of the pool? I'm not sure, but would like to look into it further.
